def match_brackets(s: str) -> bool:
    """
    Returns True if the sting has matching brackets, otherwise False.
    The program checks if for each bracket ( '(', '[' '}' ) there is a matching
    closing bracket. Note, the order and type of the brackets is important.
    For example, if you open a '(' and then a '[', then you need to "close" first
    the ']' before the ')'.
    An example of a matching bracket sting is for example
        "(a [b (c {dd} ) ] [2] )"
    where the following strings are not:
        "(a [b ) ]"  <--- closes [ with a )
        "]b ["   <--- close with ] before opening
        "{{ a }"   <-- missing }
